        Hello this is my videos page where i have a list of some of my most viewed videos up on youtube.
        I have gained over 800 subscribers without any intention of getting even 1 real subscriber when i had started in the day 1 video.
         Reading all of the comments and suggestions from people i have come across through my youtube page have been some of my favorite things about doing the vlog. I read each
        comment and have taken all of everyones advice consideration. Although i have come across a few trolls, the majority of my viewers have been
        very positive and supportive of my videos. I hope that my videos were a good rubric for personal health exercise for those who were following along with me.
